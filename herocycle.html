							<hr></hr>
							<p>In a time of great peril, the people of another world summon you to act as their saviour. Guided by the currents of fate, strengthened by ancient powers, you are to become ever greater, and yet that same fate will inevitably draw new threats to you and leave you scarred irrevocably. The cycle of the hero's journey will repeat, over and over again, until you break the world or it breaks you.</p>

							<hr></hr>
							<p>This CYOA is primarily divided into two stages: the Planning stage and the Adventure stage.</p>
							<p>In the Planning stage, (the stage you are in right now) you use whatever points you have to purchase options from the Growth, Change, and Damage sections.</p>
							<p>In order to end the stage, you must be at or below your Growth point limit, exactly at your Change point limit, and at or above your Damage point limit- you can always take more drawbacks, after all.</p>
							<p>Once ready, the Adventure button will light up, allowing you to switch to the Adventure stage. Your selections will be locked in, and a set of potential adventures will be made available. After choosing an adventure, and having your victory or failure determined, you will receive a new set of points and be moved back to the Planning stage.</p>
							<p>This cycle will repeat until any Stat reaches a total of 10 and triggers an End. Whether this is a Good or Bad end depends on the particular Stat, so you may wish to be careful!</p>
							<p>Note now that while Stats are used to determine success on Adventures and the End you receive, the text of each option is a better descriptor of their actual effects.</p>
							<br></br>
							<p>You may selectively toggle or scale the effects of Growth options, and specific parts of Growth options, to whatever degree you desire, up to but not exceeding their normal maximum strength. You may expect Growth options, especially those that enhance the same stat, to combine for an ultimately superior effect, even when they might seem contradictory or redundant.</p>
							<p>Change options can be resisted or temporarily disabled with some amount of effort. Expect to require a small amount of active effort to avoid slipping back to the 'base state' they set.</p>
							<p>Damage options are very difficult to counteract. The more fully you have undone or mitigated their effects, the harder it becomes to weaken them another step. Should you not maintain active efforts to keep them at bay, they will very quickly return to full strength. In places where they <i>directly</i> conflict, absolute statements made by Damage options should override those made by Growth options.</p>
							<p>It is possible to acquire new abilities outside of the options you take. The world you were summoned to is filled with magic and advanced yet rather un-industrial technology.</p>

							<p>You are extremely fast, capable of acting at up to 60x normal speed. This is entirely selective; you may decide to heal at an enhanced rate while moving and thinking at normal speeds. Negative or unwanted processes, including aging, the progression of biological needs like hunger and breath, the accumulation of stress and boredom, and the progression of poisons and curses can be forced to progress in realtime while you maintain maximum acceleration in other areas, though not slowed beyond this level.</p>
							<p>You can diminish the effects and/or consequences of air and water resistance, frictional heat buildup, momentum transfer, relativity, the speed of light, the speed of sound, and the like up to your full acceleration factor, avoiding the standard flaws of rapid movement and allowing you to pull off such feats as carrying a glass of liquid full to the brim at 60 miles an hour without spilling a drop, even when you stop on a dime. Any projectile you launch while accelerated may maintain as much of this effect as you desire, for up to three seconds.</p>

You are now capable of increasing your acceleration factor through training and any augmentative effect designed with it in mind (such as a custom spell or precisely-tailored cybernetics). The growth this provides is linear at worst; you will never find the returns of a year's training to be less than the last years, though they may be proportionately less significant when compared to your new maximum.</p>

							<p>Whenever you find yourself in a contest of speed with another entity, you will, at worst, slightly surpass them. You will never find that a foe can move and strike faster than you can see, even for brief moments of maximum exertion, nor that your quarry can outpace you. Effects beyond this that would increase your speed, but not to beyond your opponent's speed, will have no additional benefit; you are already being artificially raised to their level.</p>

							<p>You are enveloped in a shroud of telekinetic power, which acts semi-autonomously as best suits your will and desires. Though it has limited capability to outright generate force, it can redirect force very effectively, and though it is normally has very short range, it can spill over physical surfaces you come in contact with. Simple redirections of kinetic energy allow it to improve your grip, disregard issues of leverage, and spread your weight across unstable surfaces that would otherwise collapse.</p>
							<p>While not true flight, you can adjust your momentum and rotate your body midair in ways otherwise impossible, and on the ground it is extremely difficult to make you lose your balance. Any atttacks you inflict in melee are much more controlled, and can be made more or less lethal as you wish; you could safely use a sword as a club or prevent the force of your blows from damaging vital organs. Attacks on you are blunted and dispersed to a lesser degree, a portion of the force redirected away from your most vulnerable structures and the overall attack slowed and dispersed as if you had a bit of extra padding.</p>

This aura can outright create and destroy large amounts of force and energy, enabling true flight and much stronger barriers. Range remains limited, and what you can do with the portion of your aura wrapped around another physical object is improved to a notably lesser extent.</p>
							<p>The abilities you use this aura to produce are less limited, and can include such things as absorbing and nullifying heat from what it wraps around or generating lasers from any point on your body. Though they are not limited by your understanding of them, and take minimal concentration to use, you similarly cannot develop them through purely mental efforts; repetitive, physical training and experimentation is necessary to develop novel abilities.</p>
							<p>The overall power of this telekinetic aura scales with your physical attributes- improved strength, vitality, dexterity, and so on will all improve it substantially. Should you have any other telekinetic abilities, they will empower each other; this aura will gain strength equal to the total strength of your other abilities, and grant new strength to your other abilities that totals to equal its own strength. Additionally, all other telekinetic abilities you possess will be able to function more autonomously, with a diminished need for mental focus and true understanding.</p>

This aura can outright create and destroy large amounts of force and energy, enabling true flight and the outright levitation of objects. Range swells to well over a hundred meters, and you acquire a limited sense for all things you interact with via telekinetic force.</p>
							<p>The precision with which you may manipulate force and energy, combined with the information the aura can grant you, can greatly aid all forms of crafting and manufacturing, given only small amounts of experimentation. Beyond the bare basics, everything you do with this aura requires some degree of mental focus and understanding of the forces involved, albeit much less than it seemingly should. Though you may be able to exert your power over many things at once, there is a limit to how much you can concentrate it; some objects may simply be too dense to lift, and the innate vitality of a warrior may prevent you from just crushing their heart.</p>
							<p>The overall power of this telekinetic aura scales with your mental attributes- improved willpower, additional knowledge, superior intellect, and so on will all improve it substantially. Should you have any other telekinetic abilities, they will empower each other; this aura will gain strength equal to the total strength of your other abilities, and grant new strength to your other abilities that totals to equal its own strength. Additionally, all other telekinetic abilities you possess will be able to function much more precisely and controlledly, allowing you to pull off tricks otherwise impossible.</p>

							<p>Your biology responds to threats and environmental conditions more intelligently; you will not suffer from any form of allergy, and important parts of your body will never atrophy from simple disuse.

							<p>Your body becomes extraordinary durable. To scrape away a single millimeter of your flesh is as difficult as doing so to twenty millimeters of hardened steel, no matter what form of attack is used. This reinforcement scales with the unaugmented resiliency of every part of your body; your bones are many times tougher than this.<p>
							<p>Your sheer vitality is similarly incredible, such that you can survive for well over an hour after having every drop of blood in your body removed, sprint for twelve hours without rest or water, and digest raw cellulose comfortably. Though you are not immune to poison or disease, you are much more resistant, and your body is capable of raising your body temperature by over a dozen degrees without any discomfort, and your cells and organs have access to new ways to process any toxins they detect.</p>
							<p>Expect to be able to survive and recover from anything that leaves your brain and the internals of your torso largely intact, as your wounds clot almost instantly and healthier organs take up the slack of ones destroyed in combat. Each time you recover from some form of physical harm, you will become ever so slightly more resistant to it.</p>

							<p>This does not diminish the precision with which you can exert or perceive your strength, no matter how much you are currently exerting; if you could previously judge the difference ten pounds of weight makes, you will notice when a ten ton object you are carrying becomes ten pounds heavier.</p>
							<p>Should you will it, any object you pick up can be reinforced to a degree corresponding with its size and weight; an ordinary sword will receive much less benefit than one twice as tall as you.</p>
							<p>You are not subject to the momentum generated by swinging heavy objects, nor do you need to concern yourself with stable ground becoming less so once you start swinging and lifting things.</p>

							<p>Your simple durability increases by well over an order of magnitude, and your stamina becomes truly infinite. The damage an attack can inflict upon you is solely determined by the raw power behind it; an infinitely sharp blade is no more dangerous to you than a wooden club, and a spell to turn your body into sand is no more dangerous than one that conjures fire. Even should an attack go around this, warping or erasing the medium of your existence, your body produces its own exotic forces; you will be undeterred by the erasure of the four fundamental forces or your own history alike.</p>
							<p>Nothing that lacks any form of will or intelligence can cause you true harm- a wolf is more dangerous to you than a supernova. The amount of damage any single attack can do to you is limited to one fifth of the amount necessary to kill you, and you become truly invulnerable for a period of one second after experiencing each such attack.

							<p>Your basic strength increases by a full order of magnitude, though the strength you can truly exert, in more limited situations, rises to truly ludicrous levels. Given time to do so, you can very slowly lift up any single thing, such as a castle or mountain, heft it onto your back, and move at a slow walking speed with it. This object will not be significantly disturbed by the effort, even dishes in cabinets remaining safely in place. Similarly, when in a direct contest of strength with any other being, you are guaranteed to succeed, even, and especially, if they cheat.</p>
							<p>Your strength can be applied in situations where it would simply not be valid otherwise, allowing you to punch ghosts, stab hurricanes to death, and fire a twenty-pound bow with a thousand tons of force. While standing on smooth, perfectly flat ground, you could grab hold of a spaceship and prevent it from lifting off.</p>

							<p>By pouring magic into any part of a corpse, a soul, or an undead of any kind that was once a person, you may perfectly resurrect it. This heals any wounds, undoes any bindings placed on the target after death, and soothes any woes your target may have in regards to leaving the afterlife or dying originally. This takes a very large amount of magical energy, even for someone who died moments ago, and grows linearly more expensive the longer ago your target died, but can be performed over arbitrarily long timeframes, allowing you to bring back that ancient king over the course of a few weeks.</p>
							<p>Additionally, you may apply your magic to create, and seize control of, undead. There is no limit to the amount of undead you may control, and they have no upkeep cost, even if they originally did- your vampires no longer need to drink blood, though they still can, and will still reap the full benefits of doing so. The more magical power you pour into creating an undead, the more of its original strength will be retained, and all forms of creation and control grow gradually cheaper the longer your target has been dead, in total.</p>

							<p>Your overall supply of magical energy is greatly increased, and your ability to wield white magic expands in the field of aiding the living. Whenever someone near you receives a curse, a spiritual wound, or some ailment that would be especially difficult to resolve, you gain a portion of magical energy to fill your reserves, and your natural regeneration is increased slightly by the number of people suffering from such things in your general area.</p>
							<p>You can heal any ailment, break any curse, purge any corruption, through a simple application of your magic no more complex to you than drawing breath. Given enough power, you could undo the curse dooming an entire kingdom in the space of a short evening.</p>
							<p>A whispered word, carrying a diffuse cloud of magic across a battlefield, can eliminate all trauma the survivors would otherwise have borne. Your magical healing is no longer limited by the natural healing process, allowing you to regrow lost limbs and organs and even mend damaged cybernetics.</p>

							<p>Your magic is attuned to the elements fire, air, water, and earth. By studying these elements and attaining a deeper understanding of their physical, magical, and spiritual nature, you will rapidly develop strong, non-conflicting affinities for them. Very quickly, this will greatly increase your overall supply of magical energy, and allow you to draw a significant amount of magical energy from the presence of these elements and related phenomena (such as the sun and moon).</p>
							<p>By suffusing a specimen of any of these elements with your power, you may take control of it, moving and reshaping it with your will and taking in information on its current state. With enough power, you may create more of any element, though this is much costlier with heavier substances. As your affinity for an element rises, this will become cheaper and easier, though as you stray from the "natural form" of the element, this will grow costlier and more difficult- pure gold is harder to work than raw stone.</p>

							<p>Nestled within your affinity for each element is a spark of motive force. Nurturing this force with large amounts of magical energy, you can split off smaller sparks, using them to create loyal elemental beings. Unless you actively, intentionally give them the spark of true intelligence, they will be as automatons, nonsapient and ethically safe for any form of abuse.</p>
							<p>These elementals possess their own limited supplies of magical energy, which they will allow you to tap as necessary. You can give your elementals bodies composed of any substance or substances you can manipulate with your elementalist magic, and they will be able to maintain them, even slowly conjuring new material as necessary. The stronger their bodies, and the more physical force they are able to exert with them, the less your elementals can wield their magic to manipulate the world around them. Those anchored in heavy bodies can be dispersed through physical damage alone, but are near-immune to magical attack, while those remaining as diffuse spirits are the opposite.</p>

							<p>Your overall supply of magical energy is greatly increased, and now extends to a deeper yet still-material level. With a minimal expenditure of power, you may convert one element into another, condensing fire into air into water into earth, or dissolving stone into vast firestorms.</p>
							<p>As your elemental affinity and understanding of the materials and processes improves, you may perform more precise transmutation, condensing the heat of a firestorm into a gold coin or a sliver of metal into a mesh of delicate wires. Through a complex process of partial transmutation, you may infuse elemental attributes into any material thing- no matter how powerful or complex it already is- without hindering it in any way save removing previous elemental infusions. A shield infused with elemental water might self-repair, flowing and resolidifying like water and ice, while an armor plate infused with air might maintain an effective mass less than a tenth what it should be.</p>

							<p>By meditating on any sort of being, a classification of creature about as broad as undead, demon, or humanoid, you can nurture a baleful light, innately hostile to all of their kind. You can do this any number of times, creating as large an array of such lights as you desire. For each such light, you effectively gain a small reservoir of magical power, which refills when its chosen foes are destroyed and is only useful for effects antagonistic to them.</p>
							<p>Any of these lights- though only one for each individual effect- can be worked into any effect- any form of magic, any mundane blow, any item you craft- allowing it to inflict additional harm to your target, weaken their resistances, and take the place of any particular weaknesses they may have, as well as rendering it proof to any attempts to manipulate or control it by your chosen foe short of outright destruction. A simple infusion of a light that hates the undead into an ordinary man can make his blood burn like holy water in a vampire's mouth for several days.

							<p>What you create does not need to abide by the physical laws of your reality, or even any one reality. You can weave together the unique underpinnings of multiple possible realities in your creations, permitting such odd things as a metabolism fueled by the reversal of genetic decay or such simple things as ice spells of incredible power.</p>
							<p>Each reality you draw from must first be studied, in order to obtain the necessary mastery to use them in this way, though there is almost no limit to the level of mastery you can obtain nor to the benefits it will provide.</p>
							<p>With ordinary materials, you can do quite a bit, and more potent and exotic substances function even better, drawing more power from them than they truly contain, but the most potent applications of this require some amount of material derived from these realities. This might entail a process of careful alchemical transmutation, or the simple synthesis of an anomalous element-117 in a particle accelerator. As you learn more, you will always discover new materials, yet costlier and yet superior, such that the most potent might beggar worlds to forge a single blade, yet what you can do with the simplest things will continue to improve with your peak.</p>

							<p>Your soul shifts slightly, becoming a suitable anchorpoint for the accumulation of belief.

This belief condenses around your soul, becoming a new metaphysical organ that acts out your will autonomously.</p>
							<p>Those who worship you, who align themselves with you or your interests, or who you wish to protect will receive blessings from this organ, the power of belief burned to warp the world. Though your control over the precise effects it applies is limited, you can easily direct its growth, shaping it to enact effects of a specific kind- subtler, more blatant, perhaps aligned to a particular theme, and so on.</p>
							<p>Given time, your divine heart will grow strong enough to pull additional power from additional sources appropriate to its nature- battle, acts of healing, the presence of magic, whatever suits the manner in which you have shaped it already.

The only true way to counteract this is to invest ever-greater efforts into keeping you captive. For a short time after you escape, it will be next to impossible to recapture you.</p>
							<p>Should those that have captured you wish for your death, or to inflict another semi-permanent ailment such as mind control or crippling, they will be unwilling to do so quickly or simply. They may feel the need to put you through a trial of adversity, to bring you to a specific ritual site, or to place you in an overly complicated death trap. No matter how they go about it, you will have at least a decent chance of escaping fully intact, and will not be worn down from repeated attempts in such a way that your odds of doing so drop.</p>

							<p>The worse the situation becomes, the more benefits you receive to help you face it. This mostly comes in the form of new options and opportunities that would not otherwise exist, such as a weak point opening in the armor of an invincible monster. Your powers are more likely to expand in utility than gain a surge of raw strength, and you are more likely to find a magic sword tailored to defeat your current foe than one simply stronger than what you previously used. What options arise, specifically, depends on what would most help you against the current threat.</p>
							<p>The benefits of this effect degrade only slowly once the problematic situations ends or becomes calmer, and never vanish completely- you will always be better than you were before, once everything comes to a close. Additionally, any opponent you face will find that they need to exert real effort to defeat you, no matter how strong they may be, and you have a good chance of succesfully inflicting significant harm. You could plausibly avoid detection by a post-singularity AI pulling data from a network of ground observation satellites that can spot individual motes of dust with nothing more than camouflage-pattern cloth, then sneak into a critical manufacturing center made of eldritch alloys and blow it up with a few sacks of black powder.</p>

So long as it remains active, you are brought back to full power each time your heart beats (this is not negatively impacted by a lack of a heart), and cannot die. All of your attributes, abilities, and powers become significantly stronger, enough such that you have, at minimum, a fair chance of defeating whatever will cause this catastrophe. Any barrier that would stop you from reaching or targeting the source is removed, and you are given sufficient information to understand what the source is- should an asteroid be about to hit a planet on the other side of the universe in the next multiverse over, wiping out a civilization of billions, you could choose to intervene, and instantly appear on-site.</p>
							<p>This ability will never overwhelm you with information nor with guilt, though you cannot use the strength it grants save to combat the coming catastrophe.</p>
							<p>Once the catastrophe is averted, occurs, or seven minutes pass, this ability immediately ends. You are optionally returned to the location you inhabited when it activated, lose all but the faintest spark of the power you were granted by it, and cannot use the ability again for a full three days.</p>

							<p>Your allies, be they old friends standing by you or enemies begrudgingly cooperating for a brief time, are applied much more effectively. They will never fight amongst each other, worry about future betrayals to such a degree as will hamper effectiveness, bicker needlessly, or take other such wholly-detrimental actions. Even if they know nothing of those they work alongside, they will be able to work together and function as combined units with more effectiveness than if they were a perfect gestalt consciousness. This does not directly facilitate information exchange between your allies, but ensures such exchanges occur without flaw and prevents lack of communication from hampering their coordination. Those of your allies that would best handle a situation will happen to be present or nearby when it begins; this extends even to non-allies you will be able to recruit during the situation, and to long-dead, captured, or crippled allies, who will appear at the peak of their capabilities.</p>
							<p>Growth comes to your allies much more easily and effectively; this is not limited to something as simple as more power or new powers, but warps events around them to provide beneficial character development. This growth is guided, such that by the time any situation arises, you will find that you have allies who are almost perfectly suited to handle it.</p>
							<p>No matter the gulf in raw power that may exist between your allies and the situations you strive to handle, they will always be, at minimum, helpful.</p>
							<p>Situations this ability applies to may include personal combat, mass battle, crafting projects, disaster relief, research projects, diplomatic meetings, surgical procedures, and so on. This effect may activate even for situations you never personally encounter, or learn of, so long as any ally of yours could reasonably become present and you would want it handled by them.</p>

							<p>You have constant access to high-quality guidance, ranging in nature from subtle urges to a voice in your head in accordance with your current wishes. It will help you find the best route to victory, and avoid the worst options. This guidance is as the best version of you would provide, coming from a semi-realized aspect of your own innate potential rather than any external source.</p>
							<p>Over time, as you make use of it, it will teach you to see every possible choice and understand the consequences of them all, and, if you work for it, to become a better version of yourself; not gathering power but naturally acquiring wisdom or making other essential, personal improvements. If you ever begin to simply rely on this guidance to make every decision for you, it will reduce the amount of help it offers to whatever degree is necessary to maintain both your safety and your ability to act independently.</p>
							<p>Beyond simple good decision making skills, the guidance engine is capable of generating coincidences and pulling information from nowhere. Should it be necessary for the choice you ultimately decide upon, fate can be manipulated to put pieces into place days or weeks before the decision is made. Perhaps it so happens that four days before you realize you need to break into a facility, you help a random stranger out of an accident, earning a favor from what turns out to be one of the guards. Even when they are impossible to glean through normal means, the consequences of your potential decisions are much clearer. If setting a paint can on a specific shelf will likely cause it to fall on a monster when it pursues you later, stunning and slowing it, you will be able to recognize that doing so will benefit your odds of near-future survival; if ducking right now will let you avoid a sniper's bullet, you will know to do so.</p>
							<p>As you learn from this guidance, you will become much more capable of wielding the powers tied to it directly, and they will slowly grow more powerful and effective.</p>

							<p>You, and everyone you would consider an ally, benefit from a significant luck-based advantage in all things. With a very basic understanding of a skill, you could match a trained professional every time through remarkably consistent beginner's luck. As your actual capabilities grow, the benefits of this luck similarly swell to provide a similar proportionate advantage. A similar luck-based disadvantage is applied to everything attempted by someone you would consider an enemy. The degree to which constant misfortune hampers them and reduces their performance similarly scales with their power.</p>
							<p>Though the effect of this power will never fall below this baseline level, it has a small chance each time it activates to apply a significantly greater effect. Each time the effect is amplified, there is another small chance it is amplified again; there is no limit to this save improbability (no luck or fate manipulating effect can increase the odds of amplification). Though extremely, incredibly small, there is a chance a young peasant boy who dreams of fighting alongside you can throw a pebble at the dark knight laying waste to his village and see it pass through armor, skull, and brainmeats alike. There is no range limit to this power.</p>

The ability of all parts of the body to stretch, compress, bend, and distort without pain, damage, or loss of function, for the purposes of sexual activity, are enormously expanded; at the upper limit, an unexceptional woman relying on this could stretch to fully envelope something twice her height.</p>

This prevents any one attack from killing you simply by hitting something particularly vital; a strike barely greater than a papercut used to slit a major artery will do almost nothing to you. Even minor wounds, such as repeated stabs to one part of one foot, may eventually kill you. Though natural healing is well-suited to repairing this dispersed damage, very simple healthcare may be somewhat less useful.</p>
