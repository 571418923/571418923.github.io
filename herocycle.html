							<hr></hr>
							<p>In a time of great peril, the people of another world summon you to act as their saviour. Guided by the currents of fate, strengthened by ancient powers, you are to become ever greater, and yet that same fate will inevitably draw new threats to you and leave you scarred irrevocably. The cycle of the hero's journey will repeat, over and over again, until you break the world or it breaks you.</p>

							<p>This CYOA is primarily divided into two stages: the Planning stage and the Adventure stage.</p>
							<p>In the Planning stage, you use whatever points you have to purchase options from the Growth, Change, and Damage sections.</p>
							<p>In order to end the stage, you must be at or below your Growth point limit, exactly at your Change point limit, and at or above your Damage point limit- you can always take more drawbacks, after all.</p>
							<p>Once ready, the Adventure button will light up, allowing you to switch to the Adventure stage. Your selections will be locked in, and a set of potential adventures will be made available. After choosing an adventure, and having your victory determined, you will receive a new set of points and be moved back to the Planning stage.</p>
							<p>This cycle will repeat until any Stat reaches a total of 10 and triggers an End. Whether this is a Good or Bad end depends on the particular Stat, so you may wish to be careful!</p>
							<p>Note now that while Stats are used to determine success on Adventures and the End you receive, the text of each option is a better descriptor of their actual effects.</p>

							<p>You are extremely fast, capable of acting at up to 60x normal speed. This is entirely selective; you may decide to heal at an enhanced rate while moving and thinking at normal speeds. Negative or unwanted processes, including aging, the progression of biological needs like hunger and breath, the accumulation of stress and boredom, and the progression of poisons and curses can be forced to progress in realtime while you maintain maximum acceleration in other areas, though not slowed beyond this level.</p>
							<p>You can diminish the effects and/or consequences of air and water resistance, frictional heat buildup, momentum transfer, relativity, the speed of light, the speed of sound, and the like up to your full acceleration factor, avoiding the standard flaws of rapid movement and allowing you to pull off such feats as carrying a glass of liquid full to the brim at 60 miles an hour without spilling a drop, even when you stop on a dime. Any projectile you launch while accelerated may maintain as much of this effect as you desire, for up to three seconds.</p>

You are now capable of increasing your acceleration factor through training and any augmentative effect designed with it in mind (such as a custom spell or precisely-tailored cybernetics). The growth this provides is linear at worst; you will never find the returns of a year's training to be less than the last years, though they may be proportionately less significant when compared to your new maximum.</p>
							<p>Given additional efforts, you may develop new abilities of any sort that makes sense as an extension of 'enhanced speed', such as a form of control over vibrations; these abilities scale in power with your maximum acceleration factor.</p>

							<p>Whenever you find yourself in a contest of speed with another entity, you will, at worst, slightly surpass them. You will never find that a foe can move and strike faster than you can see, even for brief moments of maximum exertion, nor that your quarry can outpace you. Effects beyond this that would increase your speed, but not to beyond your opponent's speed, will have no additional benefit; you are already being artificially raised to their level.</p>

							<p>You are enveloped in a shroud of telekinetic power, which acts semi-autonomously as best suits your will and desires. Though it has limited capability to outright generate force, it can redirect force very effectively, and though it is normally has very short range, it can spill over physical surfaces you come in contact with. Simple redirections of kinetic energy allow it to improve your grip, disregard issues of leverage, and spread your weight across unstable surfaces that would otherwise collapse.</p>
							<p>While not true flight, you can adjust your momentum and rotate your body midair in ways otherwise impossible, and on the ground it is extremely difficult to make you lose your balance. Any atttacks you inflict in melee are much more controlled, and can be made more or less lethal as you wish; you could safely use a sword as a club or prevent the force of your blows from damaging vital organs. Attacks on you are blunted and dispersed to a lesser degree, a portion of the force redirected away from your most vulnerable structures and the overall attack slowed and dispersed as if you had a bit of extra padding.</p>

This aura can outright create and destroy large amounts of force and energy, enabling true flight and much stronger barriers. Range remains limited, and what you can do with the portion of your aura wrapped around another physical object is improved to a notably lesser extent.</p>
							<p>The abilities you use this aura to produce are less limited, and can include such things as absorbing and nullifying heat from what it wraps around or generating lasers from any point on your body. Though they are not limited by your understanding of them, and take minimal concentration to use, you similarly cannot develop them through purely mental efforts; repetitive, physical training and experimentation is necessary to develop novel abilities.</p>
							<p>The overall power of this telekinetic aura scales with your physical attributes- improved strength, vitality, dexterity, and so on will all improve it substantially. Should you have any other telekinetic abilities, they will empower each other; this aura will gain strength equal to the total strength of your other abilities, and grant new strength to your other abilities that totals to equal its own strength. Additionally, all other telekinetic abilities you possess will be able to function more autonomously, with a diminished need for mental focus and true understanding.</p>

							<p>Your original telekinetic shroud is no more, though this telekinetic aura retains all of its original capabilities, and more. This aura can outright create and destroy large amounts of force and energy, enabling true flight and the outright levitation of objects. Range swells to well over a hundred meters, and you acquire a limited sense for all things you interact with via telekinetic force.</p>
							<p>The precision with which you may manipulate force and energy, combined with the information the aura can grant you, can greatly aid all forms of crafting and manufacturing, given only small amounts of experimentation. Beyond the bare basics, everything you do with this aura requires some degree of mental focus and understanding of the forces involved, albeit much less than it seemingly should. Though you may be able to exert your power over many things at once, there is a limit to how much you can concentrate it; some objects may simply be too dense to lift, and the innate vitality of a warrior may prevent you from just crushing their heart.</p>
							<p>The overall power of this telekinetic aura scales with your mental attributes- improved willpower, additional knowledge, superior intellect, and so on will all improve it substantially. Should you have any other telekinetic abilities, they will empower each other; this aura will gain strength equal to the total strength of your other abilities, and grant new strength to your other abilities that totals to equal its own strength. Additionally, all other telekinetic abilities you possess will be able to function much more precisely and controlledly, allowing you to pull off tricks otherwise impossible.</p>

							<p>Your biology responds to threats and environmental conditions more intelligently; you will not suffer from any form of allergy, and important parts of your body will never atrophy from simple disuse. Though your healing rate is merely doubled, given time, you can recover from any purely physical wound that does not kill you, up to and including the loss of everything but your brain, perfectly; this effect improves all forms of healing you benefit from.</p>

							<p>Your body becomes extraordinary durable. To scrape away a single millimeter of your flesh is as difficult as doing so to twenty millimeters of hardened steel, no matter what form of attack is used. This reinforcement scales with the unaugmented resiliency of every part of your body; your bones are many times tougher than this.<p>
							<p>Your sheer vitality is similarly incredible, such that you can survive for well over an hour after having every drop of blood in your body removed, sprint for twelve hours without rest or water, and digest raw cellulose comfortably. Though you are not immune to poison or disease, you are much more resistant, and your body is capable of raising your body temperature by over a dozen degrees without any discomfort, and your cells and organs have access to new ways to process any toxins they detect.</p>
							<p>Expect to be able to survive and recover from anything that leaves your brain and the internals of your torso largely intact, as your wounds clot almost instantly and healthier organs take up the slack of ones destroyed in combat. Each time you recover from some form of physical harm, you will become ever so slightly more resistant to it.</p>

							<p>This does not diminish the precision with which you can exert or perceive your strength, no matter how much you are currently exerting; if you could previously judge the difference ten pounds of weight makes, you will notice when a ten ton object you are carrying becomes ten pounds heavier.</p>
							<p>Should you will it, any object you pick up can be reinforced to a degree corresponding with its size and weight; an ordinary sword will receive much less benefit than one twice as tall as you.</p>
							<p>You are not subject to the momentum generated by swinging heavy objects, nor do you need to concern yourself with stable ground becoming less so once you start swinging and lifting things.</p>

							<p>Your simple durability increases by well over an order of magnitude, and your stamina becomes truly infinite. The damage an attack can inflict upon you is solely determined by the raw power behind it; an infinitely sharp blade is no more dangerous to you than a wooden club, and a spell to turn your body into sand is no more dangerous than one that conjures fire. Even should an attack go around this, warping or erasing the medium of your existence, your body produces its own exotic forces; you will be undeterred by the erasure of the four fundamental forces or your own history alike.</p>
							<p>Nothing that lacks any form of will or intelligence can cause you true harm- a wolf is more dangerous to you than a supernova.

Given time to do so, you can very slowly lift up any single thing, such as a castle or mountain, heft it onto your back, and move at a slow walking speed with it. This object will not be significantly disturbed by the effort, even dishes in cabinets remaining safely in place. Similarly, when in a direct contest of strength with any other being, you are guaranteed to succeed, even, and especially, if they cheat.</p>
							<p>Your strength can be applied in situations where it would simply not be valid otherwise, allowing you to punch ghosts, stab hurricanes to death, and fire a twenty-pound bow with a thousand tons of force. While standing on smooth, perfectly flat ground, you could grab hold of a spaceship and prevent it from lifting off.</p>

This heals any wounds, undoes any bindings placed on the target after death, and soothes any woes your target may have in regards to leaving the afterlife or dying originally. This takes a very large amount of magical energy, even for someone who died moments ago, and grows linearly more expensive the longer ago your target died, but can be performed over arbitrarily long timeframes, allowing you to bring back that ancient king over the course of a few weeks.</p>
							<p>Additionally, you may apply your magic to create, and seize control of, undead. There is no limit to the amount of undead you may control, and they have no upkeep cost, even if they originally did- your vampires no longer need to drink blood, though they still can, and will still reap the full benefits of doing so.

							<p>Your magic is attuned to the elements fire, air, water, and earth. By studying these elements and attaining a deeper understanding of their physical, magical, and spiritual nature, you will rapidly develop strong, non-conflicting affinities for them. Very quickly, this will greatly increase your overall supply of magical energy, and allow you to draw a significant amount of magical energy from the presence of these elements and related phenomena (such as the sun and moon).</p>
							<p>By suffusing a specimen of any of these elements with your power, you may take control of it, moving and reshaping it with your will and taking in information on its current state. With enough power, you may create more of any element, though this is much costlier with heavier substances. As your affinity for an element rises, this will become cheaper and easier, though as you stray from the "natural form" of the element, this will grow costlier and more difficult- pure gold is harder to work than raw stone.</p>

							<p>Nestled within your affinity for each element is a spark of motive force. Nurturing this force with large amounts of magical energy, you can split off smaller sparks, using them to create loyal elemental beings. Unless you actively, intentionally give them the spark of true intelligence, they will be as automatons, nonsapient and ethically safe for any form of abuse.</p>
							<p>These elementals possess their own limited supplies of magical energy, which they will allow you to tap as necessary. You can give your elementals bodies composed of any substance or substances you can manipulate with your elementalist magic, and they will be able to maintain them, even slowly conjuring new material as necessary. The stronger their bodies, and the more physical force they are able to exert with them, the less your elementals can wield their magic to manipulate the world around them. Those anchored in heavy bodies can be dispersed through physical damage alone, but are near-immune to magical attack, while those remaining as diffuse spirits are the opposite.</p>

							<p>Your overall supply of magical energy is greatly increased, and now extends to a deeper yet still-material level. With a minimal expenditure of power, you may convert one element into another, condensing fire into air into water into earth, or dissolving stone into vast firestorms.</p>
							<p>As your elemental affinity and understanding of the materials and processes improves, you may perform more precise transmutation, condensing the heat of a firestorm into a gold coin or a sliver of metal into a mesh of delicate wires. Through a complex process of partial transmutation, you may infuse elemental attributes into any material thing- no matter how powerful or complex it already is- without hindering it in any way save removing previous elemental infusions. A shield infused with elemental water might self-repair, flowing and resolidifying like water and ice, while an armor plate infused with air might maintain an effective mass less than a tenth what it should be.</p>

							<p>While your old affinities remain, you gain new attunement to every concept- from "metal" to "weapons" to "swords" to "this sword" to "the sword blow I plan to deliver at this exact future date". Though in theory you could learn to wield the magic of omnipotence, broader fields require much more study to receive the same benefits and control. As with building elemental affinities, your supply of magical energy will grow as you develop your affinities, and you will find more and more things providing you with additional magical energy.</p>
							<p>While you can use this to replicate the effects of other choices, you will find them to be somewhat less efficient, at best, and would benefit from an incredible synergy should you both purchase and study them. As your affinity for each concept grows, your ability to pull off bizarre conceptual feats will correspondingly rise; with enough investment in cutting, you can learn to disregard distance.</p>

							<p>By meditating on any sort of being, a classification of creature about as broad as undead, demon, or humanoid, you can nurture a baleful light, innately hostile to all of their kind. You can do this any number of times, creating as large an array of such lights as you desire. For each such light, you effectively gain a small reservoir of magical power, which refills when its chosen foes are destroyed and is only useful for effects antagonistic to them.</p>
							<p>Any of these lights- though only one for each individual effect- can be worked into any effect- any form of magic, any mundane blow, any item you craft- allowing it to inflict additional harm to your target, weaken their resistances, and take the place of any particular weaknesses they may have, as well as rendering it proof to any attempts to manipulate or control it by your chosen foe short of outright destruction. A simple infusion of a light that hates the undead into an ordinary man can make his blood burn like holy water in a vampire's mouth for several days. The glow of this light is obvious to those it hates, but otherwise quite subtle.</p>

							<p>Your mind is filled with a vast library of arcane rituals for literally every occasion. No matter how much or how little time or wealth you have to spare, you will be able to find something tailor-made for your particular needs. Making use of these rituals, you can apply any of your abilities with greater range, power, efficiency, permanency, or so on, or stray farther from normal function than should be possible.</p>
							<p>A grand ritual might allow you to resurrect every corpse in the empire as a zombie, while a more modest one might let you charge up an attack for five minutes before the start of battle.</p>
							<p>With this, you may bind phenomena into place, be that place an item, location, or creature, causing them to repeat themselves endlessly- forcing a bomb to go off over and over at the center of your reactor, or a sword to continue emanating the fire spell cast upon it years ago.</p>

							<p>One of the extensions of your soul is dotted with seven nubs, each immersed in a chaotic flow of aetheric flux. Given a few minutes, a random, chaotic power will crystallize around any nub left empty. This power will dissolve about an hour later if unused, or after a few minutes of use when the power it contains runs dry.</p>
							<p>The precise nature of each power is truly random, but they will never be incredibly potent or versatile on their own, and remain limited by their internal energy reserves. You might get the power to metabolize nitrogen as if it were oxygen, to dissolve rope on touch, or to fill people's mouths with swarming insects as easily as the power to fly via gravity manipulation, fire matter-disintegrating beams, or predict the near future.</p>
							<p>No matter how weird they get, no power will ever cause you harm except by your own deliberate will.</p>

							<p>Every time you lose one of your flux derived powers, your soul builds a duplicate from the memory left behind.

By channeling your own magical energy through it, you can wield the power again, for as long as you would like.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, these memories are significantly less efficient than the original power, and can only safely channel as much power at a time as the original used. For a brief moment, you can channel any amount of power through a memory, but doing so will destroy it irrevocably.</p>
							<p>When created, each memory contains a small reservoir of magical energy, which can be tapped freely, but never restored.</p>

							<p>The powers you crystallize from aetheric flux are significantly stronger, though this power surfaces in what may seem to be bizarre ways. They are substantially less likely to produce generic abilities, such as flight or simple energy attacks. You might find an ability that allows you to forge portals between areas of extreme temperature differential, but disregards distance and the lightspeed delay entirely, or one that lets you teleport yourself into the future to dodge attacks.</p>
							<p>The particular powers you acquire are quite often suited very well to your current situation, or to a situation you will face in the near future. Moments before you realize someone unsavory is following you, you might gain the power to recolor cloth, the power to adjust the length of hair, and the power to project a specific human voice from any nearby location.</p>
